TimeTableUWP. This is gonna be my very first UWP application.
The basic idea: i'm not a big fan of 'typing on the phone', so i thought it would be easier, to make an app, which shows all the buses i can reach, with 1 or 2 clicks. Main city is Szentendre.

Future plans:
- Get location from gps or simply set the station 
- more stations to add
- maybe expand it to another city (with BKK aka Centre for Budapest Transport if im right, has an API, so it would be easier to implement)

If anyone would take a look and discovers something, feel free to contact me! :)

Funny part:
*I had to manually type all the data into the XMLs, because the Vol√°nbusz Transport Company doesn't share their API.


update: i found a workaround to send post requests to the site. big changes incoming :)
